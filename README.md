# WISHLIST


## Software Sucks

There is no god damn way this is the real world right?  It's
2023 and the following programs(things) have been in a piss
poor state for a long damn time. Either barely functional (if
at all) at best or non-existent. Open source or not, people
have broken ass implementations and cheap copies that don't get
the jobs done, with braindead UI.


## E-mail

Nope, don't even say it, it's included.

Thunderbird. Bloated browser(we'll get there) based and clunky.
The system tray has to be third-party because you know, some
morons decided that tray icons are 'too confusing for users'
(read: small brained and shouldn't be programming). There's a
set that are all GTK/QT based but I can barely tell apart. All
of those are bland and could be easily mistaken for Gedit at a
glance. Some of those can have multiple accounts that make
sense, some can't apparently. Other clients include electron
bloat, chroot/docker bs or some type of full web server based
crap that has shit interfaces, lack of readability/use and
don't even attempt multi account, even with plugins that's
bonk. Most of this leaves Thunderbird the best and most
common. I still go with simple but crummy old GTK client(s)
because they use less memory and are more responsive
(you know, if you're not currently pulling mail or searching
or doing anything that may block closing or interacting with
the whole program -.-). Even Microsoft Outlook isn't what it
used to be, I heard. Did the web kings like yahoo and g-mail
just swipe everyone to the curb?


## Hex-editor

No, doesn't exist. Most of 'em are for Windows, even though
I am impressed some of those are open sourced. The idea is
kind of simple: here's some hex, in a text box - ok go.
CLI editors are garbage and not really usable. There
are a few open source, yet outdated or abandoned, GUI ones
out there for Linux. But even the paid crap is seemingly a
clone of those. Search? May work... Highlighting, tagging,
diffing (CO-RECT-A-FUKING-LY) - don't get your hopes up.
Segfaulting too, it's amazing how you can fuck up what
is essentially text-editing that bad. It could be easier
to do a git diff on a web page with proper highlighting
like github.


## Text editing

You know, I wasn't going to put this in here, but when
I started formatting and checking things after all of
the other sections, so many things went wrong. I'm not
talking about full blown IDEs even. Gedit I deal with.
Most others I've tried are mediocre. Notepad++ was(is)
the least "wtf" if you ask me. Finding with Ctrl+F only
working the first time until you close the find sub-window.
Libreoffice doing some weird replace or spellcheck fixing.
Easiest to use vim.

## Browsers

The obvious - Chrome, you get pretty much one choice - Chrome.
Now, you can go with Firefox, and I do whenever I can. But none
of it's the same anymore. Firefox has a lot of issues, from the
company corpo side down to the infectious web tech that I would
trade back for Flash if I really think about it. Besides that
Chrome(ium) takes wayyyy too long to compile. Code's complex,
sure. But the fact it takes 50% of the time of an entire OS
is just BS. Killer part is it's used in so many places like
electron apps (most chat 'desktop programs') or side web
based libraries. Plenty of people have gotten into this
topic before so I'm not going to waste my breath. Embedded
telemetry, crypto currency, privacy issues, yada yada. Only
way to get less than 1GB out of a browser is an empty
about:blank window ffs. Everything web is too convoluted
and we're running out of options.


## Search engines

Another horse that has been beat to death.

Seriously Google, what are you thinking? I swear these mfs are
just breaking their own knee on purpose. Adding random keywords
to the already randomized order of top buttons for
images/videos/news/maps? Why? Just...fuking why? Obviously ads
and the general disintegrating state of search as a whole. But
it's just pathetic.

Then again, this stems from a company that decides to name
things with a simple \<common and hard to search word> +
\<company name>. What do you expect?


## VOIP

Ooooooh fuckin boy. VOIP. Softphones. You know...that thing
that was supposed to revolutionize the world when Skype was
a big thing not owned by Microsoft and Zoom was still a
twinkle in its daddy's eye. Linphone is the only thing I
almost got working. I say almost because, the UI is TRASH.
All these years and they still haven't gotten something you
can primate smash to add an account and send a text or make
a call. And the worst part is, they know it's trash, because
I've seen mailing list and forum questions where it's admitted.
To top it all off the whole software stack seems to be
'library-ized' into separate parts, but I'm not aware of
anything that uses any of those. Could be in a single big
file for all I care. Beyond that are paid programs and the
all too common "Microsip with wine".


## Chat

As already mentioned, most chat is web based. Fair enough,
I can see the usefulness of that. But my god are these
people idiots. No one likes any of these. Some programs
there is no way anybody tested because no user will
remember every single message and have to click 1000 times
a day to open up new shitly implemented threads. All
threads usually do is make me wonder why chat programs
aren't a god damn forum. Well, they are, they're just the
absolute worst attempt at a real-time forum in half a dozen
ways. I remember AIM (AOL Instant Messenger. That's
America-Online for anyone born after 2000) being a better UI,
responsiveness and overall experience than any of the Slacks,
Zooms, Skypes, Mattermost of today. (No I'm not listing the
10 or 20 some Google branded chat programs, are you crazy?)

And again, like e-mail, most of these are so obviously copied
homework it's a joke. What the fuck are you possibly adding?
And why are half of you adding export features to these
other competitors' chat software? Come the fuck on.


## Emulators

I hate RetroArch. There, I said it. A lot of varying consoles
and Windows vs Linux versions. Some work better on Windows.
There's plenty of projects that have been dropped, which I can
understand. No one is going to upkeep changes like ffmpeg, or
\*gag* Wayland, forever. Just unfortunate. Most of the time I
find configuring controllers the hardest part. Maybe some
tweaking for settings or quirks of w/e game or system.
Mupen has been in a weird state for a while. I find the GUI
is just a lost cause and it's easier to kill it and re-run
than fight with anything not working in the window.

I will say one positive thing.

Dolphin is the mother-fucking-shit.


## Languages Themsleves


This is kind of a tack-on but I'm still frustrated that most
languages are scripting interpreters and the compiled stuff is
still largely crap syntax and slow to compile when everything
is actually just operations going 'beep-boop: add, subtract,
move memory please'. I've been told to try Rust but there are a
few things that bother me about its main selling point,
along with package management (which even Linux can't get 100%)
of the language itself that breaks various pieces of software
that rely on it. I just want a meta-programming (use the lang
to self describe a per-procesesed expansion better than C/++'s
horrible macros), dynamic-executing (a lot to ask for RWE
hacker-ish morphisms, I know), that can be compiled quick and
do something complex in as little lines of code as a scripting
language. Out of everything here this is the biggest ask.


## Fones (Phones - apps)


If you've been paying attention, all of these are desktop side.
There's far too much to put a list of the mobile space. When
smartfones became a thing I was excited to soon get a mini
computer with a keyboard (RIP Blackberry) that I had root on,
and could put any standard software on (cross compiling ARM was
pain). That died quick and now we have all these rectangles with
100s, 1000s of shit programs that barely do Unix philosophy,
'one thing well'. There are a few things that were either
directly designed with fones in mind, or just happen to be
better than the desktop equivalent. But for the most part I'd
say everything in this list goes double for any Android or iPhone.



### Outro


I know how hard it can be to 'force' yourself to work on a
piece of software you won't get money for, or are too drained
to bother with after a job. I also know how life can suk
your soul away and you loose whatever passion, vision or
just plain love for whatever it is you wanted to work on.
Updating issues and dealing with assholes giving you shit
for something that is FREE can be a motivation kill. But,
at the same time I see paid software that has as many bugs
(sometimes more) and clearly doesn't drive motivation. It
really feels like nobody cares anymore. Like the grand
luster of tech and the internet has already withered away
as quick as everything became exciting and innovative.
I started writing this pissed, now I'm kind of sad.

My wishlist is long and demanding,
but at the same time a simple courtesy.
If anybody out there is able to do a little better,
can you?

With that said ... https://youtu.be/KpWqTjLn7Fg HAND :)
